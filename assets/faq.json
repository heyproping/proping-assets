}, 
{
  "question": "Who is the product for?",
 "answer": "Our daily emails are designed for real estate agents. We recognize the plethora of activities occurring each day within an agent's target market. New listings appear, properties are sold, prices fluctuate, and some listings are withdrawn. Agents often navigate through various platforms like REA and RP Data to stay updated. Proping serves as a one-stop-shop that agents can rely on at the start of their day. Consider us your daily digestâ€”an indispensable briefing for every agent eager to jumpstart their morning."

{
  "question": "What are the different types of prices shown in our emails?",
 "answer": "The Listing Price (labeled as 'price') mirrors the most current price stated on the listing. The "Price Guide" (labeled as 'price guide') is extracted from the listing's display title. "Proping Estimate" is an approximate calculation by our proprietary algorithm, intended to offer a ballpark understanding of the property's market positioning. It's crucial to recognize that this estimate is indicative and shouldn't be solely relied upon for complete accuracy."
}, 
{
  "question": "What is 'price change data'?",
 "answer": "We diligently track listings for any alterations in pricing. If we detect a variance between the price listed yesterday and the one today, we compute the change and feature it in the email, signifying whether the shift is positive or negative. This data indicates that listing agents have adjusted the price, and we strive to promptly inform our agents of such modifications in their target market."
